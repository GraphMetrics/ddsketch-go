This repo contains a Go implementation of the distributed quantile sketch algorithm
DDSketch[1] originally developed by [DataDog](https://github.com/datadog/sketches-go)â„¢. DDSketch has relative-error guarantees for any quantile q in [0, 1].
That is if the true value of the qth-quantile is `x` then DDSketch returns a value `y` 
such that `|x-y| / x < e` where `e` is the relative error parameter. DDSketch is also 
fully mergeable, meaning that multiple sketches from distributed systems can be combined 
in a central node.

The default implementation, returned from `NewDefaultDDSketch(relativeAccuracy)`, is
guaranteed not to grow too large in size for any data that can be described by a
distribution whose tails are sub-exponential.

Others implementations are also provided, returned by `LogCollapsingLowestDenseDDSketch(relativeAccuracy, maxNumBins)`
and `LogCollapsingHighestDenseDDSketch(relativeAccuracy, maxNumBins)`, where the q-quantile
will be accurate up to the specified relative error for q that is not too small (or large).
Concretely, the q-quantile will be accurate up to the specified relative error as long as it
belongs to one of the `m` bins kept by the sketch. For instance, If the values are time in seconds, 
`maxNumBins = 2048` covers a time range from 80 microseconds to 1 year.
